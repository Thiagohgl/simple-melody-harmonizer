# simple-melody-harmonizer

This is a very simple app that finds harmonies for given chord-transition notes. Its main goal is to be used as a tool to quickly prototype new musical ideas without having the hurdle of having to figure out/calculate/remember which progressions may be used for a given melody and desired intention.

# Use 
First define the transitions notes of your melody by playing them on the keyboard. Each note need to be fixed individually by clicking at the “Fix Note” button. Do this for all the notes for which you want to define a transition.

Then, click on “Find Harmonies” and you’ll find different harmonizations. You can either just hear each result or save them for future reference. You can also create and save your own progressions.
